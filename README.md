# Melody generator with RNNs 
<hr>

The goal of this project is to learn how to apply machine learning techniques to produce music. In this project I'll being training Google Magenta's Melody RNN model from scratch using songs in symbolic representation "midi" of Pop and Electronic songs. Midi describes the music using a notation containing the musical notes and timing, but not the sound or timbre of the actual sound.
