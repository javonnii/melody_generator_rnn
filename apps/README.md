# Overview of Magenta.js web application and Making Magenta interact with Music application

<hr>

Here I'll use the checkpoint converter to convert the trained "baseline RNN model" for magenta.js.

* In the converted base directory you'll find the files generated from the converter. The config file will be called upon when I open the index.html to instantiate the trained model on the web.

``` bash 
python -m http.server

open index.html

```
